# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis - Explain the purpose of the new analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help PyBer create a summary data frame of their business model. We broke down their business to see how the Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas performed individually. The main reason we performed this analysis was to eventually give their CEO 3 business recommendations to address disparities between the three city types.
## Results - Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
During the analysis, we see that:

- The urban rideshare has majority of the total rides, drivers, and fares
- Contrary to the point above, the rural rideshare has the highest average fare per driver and average fare per ride

The Urban cities naturally have a higher population, allowing them to have 1,625 total rides. 1,000 more than suburban(625) and 1,500 more than rural (125). Urban cities have 2,405 drivers compared to 490 in the suburban cities, and 78 in the rural areas. Lastly, The total urban fares were $39,854.38, which is $20,000 more than suburban($19,356.33) and $35,000 more than rural ($4,327).

Another key finding was the average fare per ride was $10 more for rural cities with it being $34.62, which is $4 more than suburban ($30.97) and $10 more than urban ($24.53). The average fare per driver is also highest in the rural cities with $55.49, which is $16 more than suburban ($39.50) and nearly $40 more than urban with $16.57. 

Below is the data table showing these findings

## Summary - Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
Based on the findings above, my recommendations to the CEO would be to:

1. Get rid of inactive or low-performing drivers in the urban cities. Why? Because the ratio of drivers to riders in the rural and suburban sector is nearly 1:1 -- whereas the urban sector is very dispersed. Doing this will allow a more accurate representation of the business and the updated numbers could show higher averages per ride and driver. Simply, the demand for drivers is there but the supply of drivers is too high
2. Relocate urban drivers to the outskirts of cities. As we see, the demand for rides is higher than the supply of drivers. Not to assume anything, but there could be a possibility that more people are not ordering Pyber rides because the wait times are too long or they simply can't get a driver. This is money lost for the company and placing more drivers there could allow for the suburban and rural cities to help make more money for Pyber.
3. I would focus more on the rural cities. The average fare per ride is a whopping $34.62. I would try to recruit more drivers to work in that area. The average fare per ride is too high and could be a possibility that the rural area of the company is not growing.
